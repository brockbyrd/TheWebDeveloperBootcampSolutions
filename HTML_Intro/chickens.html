    <h1>Chicken</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged
      bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000
      years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs;
      others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
      population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an annual production of more
      than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per
      year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore,
      religion, and literature.

    <h2>Reproduction and life-cycle</h2>
    <p>
      To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a
      hen (a circle dance), often lowering the wing which is closest to the
      hen.[32] The dance triggers a response in the hen[32] and when she
      responds to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the
      mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in which the male approaches
      the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive,
      she runs off; otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with
      both feet on her back. After copulation the male does a tail-bending
      display.[33]

    <h2>Origin</h2>

    <h3>Phylogeny</h3>

    <p>
      Water or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the
      Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong to, survived the
      Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds
      and their dinosaur relatives.[43]
    </p>

    <h3>Domestication</h3>

    <p>
      According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red
      junglefowl in present-day Thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with
      minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[49]
